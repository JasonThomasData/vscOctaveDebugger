+ Bug in octave, after a "dbclear all", setting another breakpoint will bring back previously set breakpoints. Apparently if I add and delete one by one, it'll work correctly.

- move todo issues to repo issues
- parse matrix elements instead of asking for each element
- why two stack requests?
- don't evaluate function names. That messes up the debug session, e.g. adds additional calls to the stack, and potentially has other side effects.
- homogenize return types
- stange atempts to evaluate "function" and "printf"

------------------------------------
Debug session begin or step
	request stack frames
		request scopes for selected frame (usually 0, the top frame, but can go up to n where n is the current stack frames depth).
			request variables for current open scopes (scope reference is only fetched if > 0) If scope is different than 0, then we need to do a dbup or dbdown before fetching the variables.
				request child variables as needed (child variable ref > 0)
